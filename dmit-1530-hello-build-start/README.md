# DMIT1530: Hello, Build!

This is a two-day review activity. In it, you will cover all of the core HTML and CSS concepts that you learned in COMP1017 â€“ Web Design Fundamentals I.

---

## Software & Tools

We will be using the following software and tools today:

1. A modern browser with developer tools. 

    Your instructor may choose to use Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, or Safari. 

2. Figma.

    You may use either the desktop or browser version of Figma with a free account. 

    Note: If you do not already have a Figma Education account, you can [sign up for free](https://www.figma.com/education/).

3. A text editor. 

    Your instructor will be using Visual Studio Code. Note that if you choose to use another text editor, you may not have access to the same extensions.

4. W3C Online Validator.

    We will validate both our HTML and our CSS.

## Methodology

### Setup

1. Start by downloading the starter files for this demonstration. These files include a .fig file and a project framework folder, which is identical to the simple project framework that we used in COMP1017. 

2. Import the provided .fig file by dragging and dropping it into Figma. 

3. Make sure that you have all of your content ready, such as text and images. 


### HTML

4. Begin your HTML. Start by figuring out what each area of the page might be and by creating those sectioning elements in your code. 

5. Next, begin to mark up the content. Whenever possible, always use a semantic element rather than a non-semantic element. Avoid elements such as `<br>`, as we will be using CSS, not HTML, for presentation.

6. Validate your code using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).
